# Structs = a special class; their only job is to have attributes and to hold data. 

# Example: 

Princess = Struct.new(:name, :age, :gender)
Bubblegum = Princess.new("Bubblegum", 16, "female")
Lumpy_Space_Princess = Princess.new("LSP", 13, "female")
Fire_Princess = Princess.new("Fire Princess", 13, "female")

puts Bubblegum.age + Fire_Princess.age
